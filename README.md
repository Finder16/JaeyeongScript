## Getting Started

To build and run JaeyeongScript, follow these steps:

1. First, download mingw (for developers, we used `llvm-mingw-20231128-ucrt-x86_64`). Also, move the files inside the downloaded mingw folder to `C:\mingw64` (all directories and files such as `aarch64-w64-mingw32`, `armv7-w64-mingw32`, `bin`, `i686-w64-mingw32`, `include`, `lib`, `python`, `share`, `x86_64-w64-mingw32`, etc).

2. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Finder16/JaeyeongScript.git
cd JaeyeongScript
```


For more options and usage examples, refer to the documentation in the `docs` directory.
